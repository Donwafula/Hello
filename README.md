Repository for HTML and CSS practice; making a full website in the process

LESSON 1: Building my first webpage

- HTML gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as e.g. headings, paragraphs or images.
- CSS styles the appearance of the content using e.g fonts/colors.
- Common HTML terms: Elements, Tags, Attributes.
- Common CSS terms: Selector, Properties, Values, e.t.c..

Code Validation
No matter how careful we are when writing our code, we will inevitably make mistakes. 
Thankfully, when writing HTML and CSS we have validators to check our work. The W3C has built both HTML (http://validator.w3.org/) and CSS validators (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) that will scan code for mistakes.
Validating our code not only helps it render properly across all browsers, but also helps teach us the best practices for writing code.

Referencing CSS...

CSS Resets:
CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers. There are a bunch of different resets available to use, all of which have their own fortes. One of the most popular resets is Eric Meyerâ€™s reset (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), which has been adapted to include styles for the new HTML5 elements.
Others: Normalize.css (http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/),focuses not on using a hard reset for all common elements, but instead on setting common styles for these elements.

Cross-Browser Compatibility & Testing: dont need to look exactly similar in every browser, but should be as close as possible.

LESSON 2: Getting to know HTML
- Semantics
- Block vs in-line elements
- <div> & <span>
- Text-based elements (bold, italics, h, p)
- Building structure (<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> elements)
- Encoding Special Characters: For reference, a long list of character encodings may be found at http://copypastecharacter.com
