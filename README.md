Repository for HTML and CSS practice; making a full website in the process

LESSON 1: Building Your first webpage

- HTML gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as e.g. headings, paragraphs or images.
- CSS styles the appearance of the content using e.g fonts/colors.
- Common HTML terms: Elements, Tags, Attributes.

Code Validation
No matter how careful we are when writing our code, we will inevitably make mistakes. 
Thankfully, when writing HTML and CSS we have validators to check our work. The W3C has built both HTML (http://validator.w3.org/) and CSS validators (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) that will scan code for mistakes.
Validating our code not only helps it render properly across all browsers, but also helps teach us the best practices for writing code.
